#Uses Reddit API to display a user's comment data. Currently, it is possible to view data on the individual words a Reddit user posts in teir comments, as well as their karma score adjusted for each word used. This shows what types of words a user typically writes in their comments, and the karma score indicates how other people vote on their comments and identifies the words most commonly appearing in higher scoring comments.
